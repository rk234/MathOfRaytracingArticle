Ray tracing is a perfect example of how math can be used to produce detailed, realistic images by modeling processes in the real world. The fairly basic implementation discussed in this article only scratches the surface of what is possible with ray tracing, but the mathematical concepts can be applied throughout computer graphics. Interested readers are encouraged delve deeper into this fascinating rendering technique and try to expand upon this article by implementing features like indirect illumination, fuzzy reflections, refraction, and volumetric rendering which would contribute to a more realistic and complete simulation.
